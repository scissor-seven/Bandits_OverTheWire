## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

## Steps
- This is starts to get a bit tricky, but with a little bit of patience and perseverance, it can be solved pretty quickly.
- First is, the 'filename'. The very first step is crazy enough. You need to ***cat*** all those files, which has ==-== as starting character of their name, in order to at least peek what's inside them.
- In order to solve this problem, I used this custom made command on terminal to cat all the files at once on terminal:
```bash
ls -1 -- -file0* | while read p; do cat -- "$p"; done
```

This command consists of **two main parts**:
1. **`ls -l -- -file0*`**
2. **`while read p; do cat -- "$p"; done`**
### **Part 1: `ls -l -- -file0*`**
- `ls -l` → Lists files in long format (with details like permissions, owner, size, etc.).
    
- `--` → Prevents `ls` from interpreting `-file0*` as an option.
    
- `-file0*` → Matches files that **start with `-file0`** using a wildcard (`*`).
    
💡 **Why use `--`?**  
If a filename **starts with a `-` (dash)**, it can be confused as an option.  
For example, `-file0.txt` could be mistaken for an `ls` option instead of a file.  
Using `--` tells `ls` that everything after it is a **filename**, not an option.

- But then, I regretted using it, as it turned my terminal into a mess of symbols and characters. Which, also proved the point that out of all the files, only one file is in human-readable format. Now how to find that?

Ok, got an idea:
```bash
ls -1 -- -file0* | while read p; do file -- "$p"; done
```

- Same concept as the above idea, except this time, we are asking it to run ***file*** for every iteration. So that it will list all the *file_types* of all the file to us, which ultimately revealed us what file(s) can be read and which cannot be.
- Rest is pretty simple, once found out which file can be read, simply read it, save the text as possible password, and try it.

You probably won't need further help on this level.

## Alternative Method (Easier)
If you find the above mentioned step a bit complex for you, simply run:
```bash
file -- *
```
This will show all the file types of files, present in the current directory. `--` ensures that any file that has `-` as starting character of name, is not misunderstood for a switch/option, and treated as a part of the name.
