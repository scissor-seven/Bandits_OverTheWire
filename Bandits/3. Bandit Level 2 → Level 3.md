## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called **spaces in this filename** located in the home directory.
## Steps
- After logging in through *ssh*, you need to cat the file, but the *file name* has spaces!
- Use the below command -

		cat "file name"
- Using double quotes in *cat* command helps reading files with spaces in their *file name*.
[ Update 2025 - single quotes work as well. 👍]
