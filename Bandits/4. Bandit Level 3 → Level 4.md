## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.
## Steps
- Solving this one requires you to start having somewhat knowledge of core concepts behind the usage of commands on Linux terminal.
- In order to list every possible thing existing in a directory (considering that it does exists, just hidden), you need to use
```bash
ls -a
```
for the purpose.
- Now that you have listed the file, you can read it using:
```bash
cat "hidden_filename"
```
- And you shall have your password for next level.
