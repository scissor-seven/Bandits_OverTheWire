## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:
- human-readable
- 1033 bytes in size
- not executable

## Steps
Before I get into explanation, I must say, you need to have a somewhat good enough knowledge in the basic tools and their functions, before going too complex and wasting your time.
I know I did, and now feel like a fool, to some extent, not entirely.

Also, I solved this using a bit different path than I should have, ignoring the needed commands to solve this level, going a bit OTT and making my own script to solve this ruthlessly, putting in the hard work, blood & sweat.

But since this is supposed to be level 5 --> level 6, and not 55 to 56 (its a joke, max level at bandit is 34), I'll be explaining the easy method here.

- As soon as you log into the bandit level 5, you'll realise what kind of manual labour you haven gotten yourself into. Looking at all those directories and the number of files within them:

- But no worries, keep calm and think, there are few parameters as well given to you at the start of this level. Use them with the ***find*** command:
```bash
find -size 1033c
```
and all your problems will solved in a sec.

You'll find the file and within it, the key to your next level. 

> There are few other things to keep in mind as well, such that what could be the file type, which can be determined using ***file*** command. As well as determining whether the file is executable or not.
> These things might not seem important, but you can wait till you find out how crucial they are. Either way, its up to you. Your life, your style of hacking!
